joke of the day:
all scientists in NASA were unable to send a rocket for a mission.
so they couldnt able to make out the error and asked scientists all over the world to help them.
everybody tried hard but nobody were able to figure out the mistake.
sardarji was standing at the corner and was laughing so the scientists got angry and asked him if he was so intelligent help them out.
so sardarji asked the people to bend the rocket for sometime and later asked them to start the rocket.
the rocket went into space.
everybody was fascinated and asked him how did he knew that so he said he used to do the same everytime with his scooter when it was not starting on his way to his work!!!!......
